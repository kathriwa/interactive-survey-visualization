The transparency pannel shows transparency to the user facilitate connection-making. The pannel has minimal visualization, except for the table. There is minimal playfulness and entry points. The text boxes in the table highlight adjacency emphasis and text-based transparency. The transparency pannel provides an explanation of all of the recommender sysetm information in the form of text boxes.
