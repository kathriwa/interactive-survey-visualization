# An Interactive Collection of Explanation Effects and User Characteristics in Recommender Systems

Adding explanations to recommender systems is said to have multiple benefits, such as increasing user trust or system transparency. Previous work from other application areas suggests that specific user characteristics impact the users' perception of the explanation. However, we rarely find this type of evaluation for recommender systems explanations.

This site accompanies the survey paper "Whom do explanations serve? A Systematic Literature Survey of User Characteristics in Explainable Recommender Systems Evaluation‚Äù ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14193)) which addresses this gap by surveying 124 papers in which recommender systems explanations were evaluated in user studies.

The Papers page provides an overview of the analyzed articles, the User Characteristics table groups the user characteristics and the measured effects, the Charts page shows the historical development of different features and how often an effect was found or not found for each user characteristic.
